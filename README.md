# Basic Logic Gates in Verilog

This project implements basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) using Verilog HDL, developed and simulated on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/).

## ðŸ”§ Files Included

- `basic_gates.v` â€” Verilog source code for basic gates
- `basic_gates_primitives.v` â€” Implementation using Verilog built-in primitives
- `basic_gates_tb.v` â€” Testbench for simulation
- `basic_gates_waveform.png` â€” Waveform screenshot from GTKWave on EDA Playground

## Simulated On

[EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/): A free browser-based platform for running Verilog and SystemVerilog code without local installation.
